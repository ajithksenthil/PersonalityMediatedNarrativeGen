# Personality Mediated Generative Story Worlds

# Introduction
Drawing inspiration from computational linguistics and computational psychodynamics, this project dives into the realm of generative story worlds. At its core is the modeling of event-driven personality and cognition to create dynamic narratives.

# Computational Psychodynamics
This methodology bridges the gap between computational linguistics and behavior modeling. Just as computational linguistics combines linguistic schemas with statistical models, computational psychodynamics offers a structured schema for understanding behavior and cognition, using tools such as Markov chains and Transformer models. Key principles include:

Behavioral schema rooted in Jungian cognitive functions

The Free Energy Principle-Active Inference (FEP-ActInf) framework

Linearly separable binary classifications for behavioral states

Transition modeling between behavioral states over time

# Features
Dynamic Modeling: Using the principles of Computational Psychodynamics, this project captures the nuances of personality and behavior in generative story worlds.

AI Integration: The methodologies emphasize potential AI applications, especially in portraying behavior and personality through multi-level binary classifications.

Ecological View of Personality: Observations of behaviors form the main source of data, ensuring a more grounded and holistic understanding of personality dynamics.

# How It Works

Behavioral Schema: At the foundation is a behavioral schema based on Jungian cognitive functions, categorizing judgment/observer functions with perception/decider functions.

FEP-ActInf Integration: The schema is connected with the FEP-ActInf framework, emphasizing the brain's role in reducing differences between predicted and actual sensory inputs.

Transition Modeling: Behavioral transitions over time are modeled using Markov chains, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Transformer models.

Generative Narratives: The behavioral models are then utilized to create dynamic narratives, reflecting realistic personality-driven scenarios.
Applications

Brain-computer interfaces: Refining cognitive models for improved interaction and understanding.

AI personalities: Create more human-like AI entities with distinct personalities.
Generative narrative worlds: Craft intricate story worlds driven by dynamic characters.
Behavior prediction & analysis: Enhance the prediction and analysis of behavior over time.

# To implement a self-supervised learning algorithm that takes pre-labeled action words and uses a semantic network to find the highest semantic similarity, you can use a neural network architecture known as a "siamese network." A siamese network consists of two identical neural networks that are trained to process input data and generate output embeddings that are semantically similar for inputs that belong to the same class, and dissimilar for inputs that belong to different classes.

# Here is an example of how you could implement a siamese network in PyTorch to classify action words into the categories (BP, BS, CP, CS):

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the number of categories and the size of the input and output embeddings
num_categories = 4
input_size = 50
output_size = 10

# Define the siamese network architecture
class SiameseNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SiameseNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 32)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(16, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = nn.ReLU(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = nn.ReLU(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Initialize the siamese network
model = SiameseNetwork()

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Define the push and pull vectors for each category
push_vectors = {
    'BP': torch.randn(output_size),
    'BS': torch.randn(output_size),
    'CP': torch.randn(output_size),
    'CS': torch.randn(output_size),
}
pull_vectors = {
    'BP': torch.randn(output_size),
    'BS': torch.randn(output_size),
    'CP': torch.randn(output_size),
    'CS': torch.randn(output_size),
}

# Loop over the training data and optimize the model
for data, labels in train_data:
    # Forward pass
    output1 = model(data[0])
    output2 = model(data[1])

    # Compute the loss
    loss = loss_fn(output1, output2, push_vectors[labels[0]], pull_vectors[labels[1]])

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
# This code defines a siamese network architecture with three fully-connected layers, and trains the network on a dataset of action words and their labels. The push and pull vectors are used to modify the output embeddings to more accurately classify the action words into the appropriate categories. You can adjust the network architecture and the push and pull vectors as needed to optimize the semantic similarity of the word
